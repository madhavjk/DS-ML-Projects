Dataset: Credit Approval Data Set(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval)
-

Steps:
-
1) First, we will start off by loading and viewing the dataset.
2) We will see that the dataset has a mixture of both numerical and non-numerical features, that it contains values from different ranges, plus that it contains a number of missing entries.
3) We will have to preprocess the dataset to ensure the machine learning model we choose can make good predictions.
4) After our data is in good shape, we will do some exploratory data analysis to build our intuitions.
5) Finally, we will build a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted.
