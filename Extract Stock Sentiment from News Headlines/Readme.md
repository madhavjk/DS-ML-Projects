### Project: To generate investing insight by applying sentiment analysis on financial news headlines from FINVIZ.com. 
Using this natural language processing technique, we can understand the emotion behind the headlines and predict whether the market feels good or bad about a stock. 
It would then be possible to make educated guesses on how certain stocks will perform and trade accordingly. (And hopefully, make money!)
